        <p class="">
          I'm a full stack developer (React.js & Node.js) with a focus on
          creating (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences
          that are fast, accessible, visually appealing, and responsive. Even
          though I have been creating web applications for over 7 years, I still
          love it as if it was something new.
